# - Write in imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds").
# - Do not end the subject line with a period.
# - Keep the subject clear and concise.
# - Use lowercase for tool names (e.g., husky, eslint, commitlint).
# - Use PascalCase or camelCase only for identifiers (e.g., fetchUserData).
# - Use wip commits only locally — squash before merging shared branches.
